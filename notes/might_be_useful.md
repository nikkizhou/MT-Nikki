## Fine tuning: Key Differences Between Transformer and Non-Transformer Models

Transformer Models:
1. Learning rate warm-up and scheduler are often used.
2. You typically freeze earlier layers in the transformer model.
3. Gradient accumulation is more frequently used due to memory constraints with large models.
4. Layer normalization and position encodings are unique to transformers and not applicable to most non-transformer models.
5. Pre-trained models are fine-tuned on task-specific data, so fewer epochs are often sufficient.


Non-Transformer Models:
1. Non-transformer models (e.g., CNNs, RNNs, MLPs) generally do not require learning rate warm-up, though it can still be useful.
2. Regularization techniques like L2 regularization (weight decay) or dropout are often the primary ways to avoid overfitting.
3. Gradient clipping is often used in training models like RNNs to avoid exploding gradients.
4. Hyperparameters like learning rate or optimizer settings may have a larger impact due to the more complex learning dynamics when working with traditional neural networks.




### Why The Result Might Not Indicate Overfitting
Balanced Performance Across Classes: The consistently high Precision, Recall, and F1-Score across all classes suggests the model is effectively handling both majority and minority classes. Overfitting would typically manifest as excellent performance on larger classes but poor generalization to smaller ones.
No Class Bias: The model doesn't appear biased toward the larger categories like "option-posing" (764 samples) over smaller categories like "none-questions" (182 samples). Overfitting often causes imbalances in class-wise performance.
High Support Scores: If this evaluation was done on a held-out test set (unseen during training), the results suggest the model has generalized well to new data, indicating a lower risk of overfitting.


2. Signs of Overfitting to Watch For
Even though the metrics look great, overfitting can still occur. Hereâ€™s how you can assess it:

Check the Training Accuracy/F1-Score: If your training metrics are also near-perfect (e.g., 99%-100%), but the model performs poorly on entirely new or slightly different data (validation/test sets), this is a sign of overfitting. Overfitted models memorize the training data but fail to generalize.
Cross-Validation Results: If you used cross-validation, compare the average metrics across folds. If there is a significant drop in performance between training and validation folds, that indicates overfitting.
Evaluation on External Datasets: Overfitting becomes apparent when you test the model on data from a different source or domain and notice a sharp drop in performance.
