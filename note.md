## Problems:
1. Data imbalance

## Notes:
1. Models: DistilBert, LLMA, 
Llama: Focused on achieving high performance while using fewer resources; 


## TODO:
1. Fine tune
3. Classify also the answers

1. Consider up-sampling or down-sampling to balance the dataset, or even exploring data augmentation strategies.
2. Stratified cross-validation
3. Use Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to artificially increase the number of instances for rare labels. This can help balance the dataset for training and testing


## Done:
1. Combine labels
2. Cross Validation
3. Find more models


## Questions:


## Meeting notes:
### 11.05
    1.Models: Llama
    2. Performance (time consumed, explainability?, generalization, robustness, memeory use, parameter size,  â€¦)
    3. Print out incorrect classifications, and find why, and try to improve
