The code is organized into the following main directories:

# Data: 
This directory is divided into several subfolders:

## original_data: 
Contains raw datasets sourced from three publicly available resources, along with processed datasets featuring labels.
## synthetic_data: 
Stores the synthetic data generated for this research.
## original_and_synthetic_data: 
Merges the original and synthetic datasets, complete with labels, into one comprehensive dataset.
# Code: 
Includes scripts for building, training, and evaluating various models, as well as scripts for generating synthetic data.

# Charts: 
Comprises scripts for plotting comparison charts/graphs for models, in addition to the generated charts themselves.

# Results: 
Displays model performance results using various metrics. The results are organized into folders based on the use of cross-validation and synthetic data, including confusion matrices and classification reports for each model.

# Notes: 
Documents meeting notes detailing challenges encountered, discussions held, label count data, and additional information relevant to the thesis.
