Because you weren't awake when everybody came home; true?,3

"Okay. You said that he was close friends with your dad, though, right?",3
"I UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT THE HOUSE WAS FULL THAT DAY OF PEOPLE, RIGHT?",3
"Okay. When you say he did it, let's talk about that. I think something you told the jury, something was a little different the third time. Was it?",3
"And at Children's Assessment Center, you actually told the interviewer that the defendant touched you inappropriately; correct?",3
"And she was asking you, why didn’t you tell me, right?",3
"If I asked you six months ago, the next day, what you wore yesterday, you would remember, right?",3
"Around 8:00 o'clock in the evening, though. Right?",3
"NOW, YOUR MOM LEFT IN ORDER TO DRIVE LAZARO'S FRIEND HOME; IS THAT RIGHT?",3
Let me finish. Wasn't she?,3
And then he moved them down. Is that correct?,3
"Once you got into the bathroom, you testified that he locked the door, right?",3
"USUALLY NO CLOCKS INSIDE THE HOTEL ROOM EXCEPT FOR MAYBE ON THE NIGHTSTAND, RIGHT?",3
"So in your testimony today you testified that Alejandro and you did have sex, correct?",3
"And until you left and went home, thinking about that; did you?",3
And you indicated that the other individuals that were living in the home were at the house when you got there. Correct?,3
"Then you talked about there was a blanket on your bed, right?",3
"BY MR. SMITH:  So you've gone back to sleep after the fourth time, is that correct?",3
"Okay. And you mentioned that when you got down to the room downstairs, that Derek took your pajama bottoms off, right?",3
And that was one time; is that right?,3
"First time.  I'm sorry.  I'm not trying to be confusing.  The first time that you were touched and the person walked away, and you just described to the jury how it was that you turned and saw that person, you saw them walking away.  And then you saw them turn and go into that room, that doorway; correct?",3
Okay. You had already testified that your hands were initially crossing your chest. Correct?,3
"well, you came in and talked to us before you went to court; isn't that true?",3
So your plans for that day got shattered; didn't they?,3
"-- describe. And you don't scream or anything, right?",3
"Okay. And in that conversation, Alfredo said that he had touched you; is that right?",3
"When you told Mayra -- I think I got this in the right order. You told your mom that he had touched you after he said he touched you, correct?",3
"THERE WAS ALWAYS SOMEBODY IN ONE OF THOSE ROOMS AT THE HOUSE, RIGHT?",3
"MS. ORTEGA: Mr. Billups: Question: You never told your mom about any incident involving you, did you?",3
"Well, he had a day off, right? Back a month or two before he was arrested, he had a regular day off, right?",3
"Okay. And then the last time you went to CALICO you spoke to Bertha, correct?",3
"NOW, BEFORE -- AT SOME POINT IT BECAME THAT ONLY YOU AND LAZARO WERE IN THE APARTMENT; IS THAT RIGHT?",3
YOU GET IN HIS VEHICLE AND YOU GO TO THE DANA; IS THAT RIGHT?,3
"Certain things, though, stand out; is that correct?",3
Okay. Her mom. And Mr. Manila and two other people went out for dinner; correct?,3
"YET YOU NEVER GO TO ANYBODY AND TELL THEM, DO YOU?",3
"Okay. Well, let's talk about what happened. You had your hands across your chest. I think you told that to the jury; is that correct? ",3
"Right. Later you said to your mom it didn't happen, right?",3
"At first, it brought the police into your life, right?",3
"YOU HAVE A HISTORY OF SLEEPWALKING, CORRECT?",3
"Because the interviewer also asked you about when you were standing up, correct?",3
"""Question: And then he immediately put his pants back on; is that correct?",3
"On direct examination, you said that you had gone to the bathroom because you were scared, right?",3
", NOW, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN WHEN I ASK -- WHEN I TALKABOUT, THERE BEING DIFFERENT KINDS OF KISSES, RIGHT?",3
That made you very scared; correct?,3
"Okay. You told us on direct examination that you never felt his body against your body, just the penetration; is that right?",3
"I'LL GO AHEAD AND TAKE DEFENSE B FROM YOU. THANK YOU. FOCUSING YOUR ATTENTION ON THE PUMPKIN CARVING INCIDENT.  WHEN LAZARO CAME INTO THE ROOM SECTION OF THE CONVERTED GARAGE, YOU WERE LAYING DOWN; IS THAT RIGHT?",3
"And that it was providing some light into that room, but there was no independent -- strike that. There was no light source in that room; correct?",3
"But you did not say, he raped me, right?",3
AND THERE WAS A DECISION MADE BASED ON THAT CONVERSATION THAT YOU COULD TAKE SOME TIME OFF OF JOB CORPS; IS THAT RIGHT?,3
"FOR THE MOST PART, YOU WERE GETTING ALONG WITH YOUR DAD A YEAR AGO, RIGHT?",3
"On direct examination, you told us that you wiped yourself off, but you didn't look; is that right?",3
You know the difference between right and wrong; don't you?,3
"So this was before he was in jail, right?",3
And that was about Saturday night. I guess that was September 6th; wasn't it?,3
"Last Wednesday when you were talking to us, you said that, if I'm right, when his hand goes down there and he's touching your vagina, that he's not saying anything; is that right?",3
"And then two days later, went and spoke with another officer, just you and the officer; correct?",3
"Okay. And your mother -- so your mother knew you were drinking, right?",3
"You didn't like Mr. Johnson, did you?",3
"In fact to get to you, your left side, they have to lean over you; correct?",3
"AND WHEN YOU GAVE YOUR STATEMENT TO THE POLICE OFFICER, THE POLICE OFFICER WROTE DOWN EVERYTHING THAT YOU TOLD HIM; IS THAT RIGHT?",3
"YOU ARE STAYING WITH WHAT YOU SORT OF REFER TO AS YOUR GRANDFATHER, CORRECT?",3
"WHENEVER IT WAS, AND I WON’T TOLD YOU DOWN TO ANY DATES RIGHT NOW, BUT BETWEEN, SAY, JULY 4TH AND DECEMBER 1ST, YOU WENT OVER TO THAT HOUSE A LOT OF TIMES, RIGHT?",3
"And that is what made you think, at least initially, that it was Mr. Manila; correct?",3
And you thought that there was a light that the dimmer switch was on.It was on low; correct?,3
And so you're not biologically related to Steven and little Eddie; are you?,3
"AND WHEN YOU DID THE COCAINE IN THE GUEST BATHROOM THAT FIRST TIME, MR. SPEAR’S WIFE WAS IN THE HOUSE RIGHT?",3
But you were at where his knees were; correct?,3
"When you are referring to your dad, you are always referring to the defendant; is that correct?",3
"Okay. That was a long time ago, wasn't it?",3
"BECAUSE YOU’D SEEN HIS UNIFORM, RIGHT?",3
"And you would go Monday to Friday, and then be at your mom's on the weekend, right?",3
BY MR. SMITH: I am going to call you Janet Doe; okay? ,3
You told us on direct that after the penetration was over you opened your eyes and you saw Alfredo's legs; is that correct?,3
"You understand -- you remember some of the conversations; is that correct, not all of them?",3
And you only told them that it had happened because you were angry; is that correct?,3
MS. CONDES: Q. So you were left alone in the room with guns in this particular time; is that right?,3
"AND ALSO ABOUT -- IT’S BEEN ABOUT A YEAR AGO NOW YOU WERE VERY GOOD FRIENDS WITH A GIRL AT SCHOOL WHO YOU HAVE SINCE SORT OF ENDED YOUR FRIENDSHIP WITH, RIGHT?",3
"AND WHEN SHE GOT HOME, YOU TALKED TO HER ABOUT HAVING LEFT JOB CORPS; IS THAT RIGHT?",3
OKAY. SO YOU WERE IN BED; IS THAT RIGHT?,3
"How was he -- going to jail was to protect you and your siblings from him, right, your dad?",3
THE HAIRCUT INCIDENT HAPPENED SECOND AND THE PUMPKIN CARVING INCIDENT HAPPENED THIRD? IS THAT ACCURATE?,3
"Jane Doe, Exhibit No. , you've already testified that that is a similar-looking reclining sofa as the one that you slept on at Janet Doe's house; correct?",3
"YOU DIDN’T LIKE HIM TOUCHING YOU INAPPROPRIATELY, DID YOU?",3
And you knew that someone else stayed in that garage; correct?,3
OKAY. AND YOU'RE IN A YELLOW BOX; IS THAT RIGHT?,3
"Burning. And then you said when you were in the bathroom, you remember feeling pain, right?",3
"So we talked about the townhouse. Then you moved to what you call the ""apartment"" that's on the second story in that same gray apartment complex. When you moved into there, were there still -- into that apartment, were there still three bedrooms? I'm sorry. There were two bedrooms in the townhouse, right?",3
And you said that you would take your clothes off. Is that correct?,3
AND SO – WELL AND THIS WAS AT THIS HOUSE WHERE THIS TOOK PLACE. THIS WAS AT A HOME IN THE OAKLAND HILLS; IS THAT RIGHT?,3
"And earlier today, this afternoon, you actually watched a portion of that interview; is that correct?, ",3
"YOU HAD MOVED OUT FROM YOUR MOTHER’S HOUSE, RIGHT?",3
"Correct? And the back of it doesn't really lean It slides down, doesn't it, like it is in that picture?",3
You also told the detective that it happened around four times. Is that safe to say?,3
"And -- well, he was the breadwinner there for a long time; right?",3
Okay. So he would come in your bedroom on his own and start doing this without you asking him to; correct?,3
"And except for maybe seeing him in court once or twice, you haven't seen him since then, have you?",3
"In fact, your mom told you how many times the defendant said he had touched you, where he touched you, and so forth; correct?",3
"Okay. Now, you said you initially came up to your friend Ricky, and word got back to the family, and things were dealt with. You weren't allowed to be in the same house -- be in the house alone with the defendant; correct?",3
"Excuse me. Now, I assume your memory of what happened back then was maybe a little bit clearer back in '09; right?",3
Okay. And your mom kept you updated about kind of what was going on as the case progressed; correct?,3
"Okay. It's not, so let me ask some follow-ups regarding that. So what you just said is when you came to the preliminary hearing back in September of last year -- right? --",3
"Okay. And that old attorney is not me, is it?",3
"Okay. And before this interview, you had actually spoken to your mother about what the defendant had said to the detective earlier when she was interviewed on April 29th, 2011; isn't that correct?",3
Okay. At that time you told her that the defendant had both touched you in the breast area but also put his hands in your underwear as well; correct?,3
Was it May 13th closer to 2012 than it is today ? We are now in July. Right?,3
"Okay. When asked on direct, you said it was no more than ten times, maybe less than eight times; correct?",3
"And I think you said one of the things you told her was that you were, quote, ""raped""; is that right?",3
"Okay. Now, you also told the detective that when he was asking you how the defendant would touch you around your vagina, in your vaginal area, you would say he wouldn't go inside of it, but he would stay on top of it; correct?",3
"Did you see alcohol in Steed's -- I'll say ""Steed."" That's how you refer to him, correct?",3
"Okay. In fact, you told the detective that he had touched you pretty much every time your mom -- or every time your mom would go to work at night; correct?",3
"Okay.  Do you remember when you, the first time was that you saw him on that morning?  And that would be Saturday morning; correct?",3
"Okay. And during the forensic interview, you also told her that he had only touched the breast area; correct?",3
Let me ask you this: There's been a lot of questions today about how much support your stepdad would provide the family over several years; right?,3
"Okay. Now, in court today you said that the defendant has only touched you two times, but you gave a different statement to Ms. Abrego back in February of 2011; correct?",3
And I know you said this morning something to the effect of you felt you were interrogated by Detective Ambito; right?,3
"And he hasn't called you on the phone since then, has he?",3
This was certainly a hard time for you when this happened; correct?,3
I think you said you're closer to your brother James than you are to Jan; is that right?,3
"You didn't tell us about that? You didn't tell them about that, did you?",3
"Okay.  Well, you were asked if you wanted anyone else in the room, if you wanted your counselor in the room. You said, ""No. I'm okay. I'll just speak to Ms. Abrego""; correct?",3
"And I think I asked you some of these questions this morning, but during that preliminary hearing, he just touched, like, right below the bottom of your belt; right?",3
"He never put his penis inside your vagina, did he?",3
"You have never even seen his penis before, have you?",3
"And Mr. Parungao never did that to you, did he?",3
I think you said earlier today that you don't really recall talking to the detective back in May of last year; is that right?,3
"And when you spoke to Ms. Abrego, no one else was in the room; correct?",3
Okay. You actually put your hand across your chest where your breasts are; correct?,3
Okay. So your mom gave you details about what the defendant admitted to the detective that day; correct?,3
"That was a common problem; wasn't it?  You wouldn't turn on the fan, and the bathroom got steamed up; correct?",3
And you became aware that sort of a CPS investigation got started after that; correct?,3
You also told the detective that he did go inside your underwear and touched you that way; correct?,3
And I asked you some questions about measurements back at the preliminary hearing; right?,3
"How much time was between you having the communication with Tina and your fight with Tina? How long did she manage to keep your secret before she betrayed you, is the question?",3
Sure. You came in here and testified at the preliminary Hearing -- remember? -- back in September; correct?,3
And you soon became aware that the police were involved.  Is that -- is that safe to say?,3
"Okay. Now, you said that he would just simply touch the breast area; is that correct?",3
"Am I correct that when you were 12 years old, you had never had sex with anyone? And I'll use the word sex defined as penetration with a penis. That had never happened when you were 12, right?",3
"If you were to have told Katie Weisberg that your stepdad forced you to have sex with him, that wouldn't be true, would it?",3
"Okay. And at the end of that interview, you had some questions for her regarding this apology letter, and she referred you to speak to Detective Ambito; correct?",3
Okay. And you told her that it happened about ten times; correct?,3
And I think you said the second overexaggeration you told was to the detective; is that right?,3
"Okay. Did he you didn't ask him to come in your room, too -- correct? when he would come in late at night; right?",3
"That's an old classic, huh? For you it's new, though; is that right?",3
Okay. And at that time you disclosed to Ms. Abrego what had happened with the defendant; correct?,3
And you didn't feel pressured to talk to her or anything like that; correct?,3
"He hasn't e-mailed you, has he?",3
Okay. Your mom also told you about the apology letter; correct?,3
So he's a really busy guy; right?,3
"And let me start out with that, actually.  You told us that the first -- at least one of the overexaggerations you told was to your school counselor Katie Weisberg; is that right?",3
Okay. But the only thing that sort of changed was that you weren't allowed to be in the same room or be alone with the defendant; correct?,3
"Okay. Now, you said that these touchings would happen when you were asleep; correct?",3
And what you meant by that is that he wouldn't actually penetrate your vagina. Isn't that safe to say?,3
Okay. You said that also he touched your leg area; is that correct?,3
"He hasn't texted you, has he?",3
And then let me ask you a question in follow-up then. You told us earlier this morning that Mr. Parungao never touched you on the vagina; is that right?,3
You also put your hand down over your vagina; correct?,3
So you didn't go in and request him to massage you. Is that safe to say?,3
"Now, when you talked to Detective Ambito on May 3rd, 2011, you actually showed him where the defendant had touched you; correct?",3
"So explain what happened. First you are with your dad, is what you said, right?",3
And he actually moved out of the house sometime in mid-May of 2011; is that right?,3
"Now, you told us today that Mr. Parungao never touched you under your underwear or inside your underwear; is that right?",3
"And what about in high school?  You didn't go there anymore after school, right?",3
And that's as far as you pulled the blanket to your face?,3
IS THAT DOESN'T HELP YOU TO REMEMBER?,3
"Well, you were also, you told the jury you were mad at Eddie?",3
"At CALICO, didn't you say that his hands were up against the wall the entire time?",3
And that was the plan that you and your dad came up with?,3
"Then after having told the officer at the Fontana Police Department that it didn't happen, you then went to the Children's Assessment Center and said it did happen?",3
And you were just frozen staring straight ahead at the wall?,3
So your mom didn't warn you at all that she was bringing a romantic figure into your life?,3
"So when Janet Doe's older sister came home, all of the adults had already left?",3
You would you agree with me you never really wanted to do chores?,3
And you wanted to go outside?,3
And that's what he was doing?,3
Okay. And you indicated that he was touching you?,3
In the living room?,3
But you told her not to say anything?,3
"I think you told the people, the woman at the Children's Assessment Center that the woman, mom, her mom, Maria, called him and that he jerked his hand away from you real quickly and walked outside?",3
"(By Ms. Martinez) Okay. Now, I just want to clarify. The defendant actually isn't your biological father?",3
"-- correct? And prior to that, the semen coming out on the ground, is when he licked your breast?",3
And you ended up getting a ride home from Steed and Shonna?,3
You don't recall telling her you had on a long skirt?,3
And then the next day the police pick you up and they take you to the CALICO Center in San Leandro?,3
AND IN HIS HOUSE THEN -- YOU ARE NOT PROBABLY FAMILIAR WITH SQUARE FEET OF A HOUSE?,3
And he had you rub his penis until semen came out?,3
"Okay. When you say ""Armando,"" you're referring to the defendant who's here in court? ",3
SO YOU DON’T RECALL ANY OTHER TIMES? ,3
"And when Mr. Martin sat down, he immediately took the gun out of his pocket and set it down on the table?",3
You said he put his hand down your pants?,3
"MS. CONDES: Q. So just to be clear, you didn't tell your mom that that happened?",3
And you said that his mouth went on your vagina?,3
ISN'T IT TRUE THAT THE PARTY HAPPENED FIRST?,3
And you went to the bathroom to spit it out?,3
"But when you came back, you came back and you went out to the backyard to eat donuts?",3
And the purpose of the plan was so your mom would feel angry and sad and not have another affair?,3
YOU NEEDED TO PAY?,3
Okay. It got your attention?,3
So where I am standing here in front of you is about how far you were away from him when you had a conversation with him?,3
And you confided in some friends about it?,3
"AND WHEN YOU INTERVIEWED WITH CALICO, YOU DIDN'T TELL CALICO THAT YOU HAD TOLD LAZARO TO STOP?",3
And you were interviewed by the police at that time?,3
You say she wanted to.  Didn't both of you want to go?,3
So today was the first day you remembered it when you told the prosecutor?,3
And you said no?,3
But you did tell the lady about it?,3
YOU NEVER HEARD THAT BEFORE?,3
As what you've described to us?,3
You wanted to just go to your dad's?,3
"NOW, ISN'T IT TRUE THAT YESTERDAY YOU TESTIFIED THAT THE PUMPKIN CARVING INCIDENT HAPPENED WHEN YOU WERE SIX OR SEVEN YEARS OLD?",3
"Well, you wanted to go meet some friends? ",3
"Went home, took a shower, and slept?",3
And were you still having sex?,3
Okay. So it wasn't always 50/50?,3
Okay. Because it was someone other than Bertha?,3
"And it was right then that he said, Austin, can you go put this away for me?",3
"And when you pushed him off, he got up?",3
And Janet Doe was up front sitting beside Mr. Manila? ,3
It's the same handwriting from the document you used to write your name when you identified Alejandro?,3
"In the Dublin house, he touched your chest?",3
"Well, you lived with them since they were born until like 2015.",3
And you told her that he asked if it bothered you?,3
SO IT WAS DARK? ,3
"Okay. It just happened to be in that text, though?",3
So you couldn't feel skin to skin at this point?,3
"-- talking to the police officers, I asked you how you were feeling, what emotions you remember having; correct?",3
And that's when I think you said it was Janet Doe that said we are gonna walk down and get donuts.  And he said I'll take you?,3
Yes? You just got home? ,3
AND YOU WOULD HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE DEFENDANT AND HE WOULD ASK YOU QUESTIONS OF A SEXUAL NATURE?,3
BY MR. SMITH: And I believe you told the jury that you heard him talking with the little girl?  ,3
You just remained living with your grandmother?,3
"-- about your dad, the defendant, touching you inappropriately?",3
Because she was just a few feet away. ,3
"OKAY. AND WHEN YOU GOT TO JOB CORPS, YOU FOUND THAT JOB CORPS WAS REALLY DIFFICULT?",3
Okay. We've gone over some of the times that the defendant -- that you said that the defendant had inappropriate sexual conduct with you and you're saying today that it's not true?,3
She was really upset?,3
And that was shocking for you?,3
You never tried to talk to him or call him?,3
AND YOU LEARNED IT IN SCHOOL BEFORE THE DAY AT GRANDMA ROSA'S?,3
And then you told her you were sorry again?,3
Okay. So sometimes these pictures were taken of you from behind?,3
BUT IT'S NOT AT THE PLACE WHERE THE FIRST INCIDENT TOOK PLACE. IT'S NOT AT A PLACE WHERE THE PARTY HAPPENED AT THE STUDIO. IT'S NOT AT THE STUDIO?,3
And you were laying down?,3
It happened in Oakland?,3
Okay. So you texted her before you talked to anyone that morning other than Jissette?,3
"You didn't go into the older sister's bedroom, the three of you, sit down and talk about things?",3
You could see her?,3
And Austin had one beer?,3
You didn't look at the time?,3
Okay. so you were mad that your mom had an affair with Alejandro?,3
MS. CONDES: Q. Was Derek -- you said he went in to take a nap.,3
BUT IT WAS BEFORE THE PRELIMINARY HEARING?,3
So you told her through text?,3
"BY MR. SMITH: Sure.  Let me rephrase that. I am sorry.  Didn't Janet Doe actually tell you that her mother said no, that you, Jane Doe, had stayed long enough?",3
Did he ever take his hand -- you said that he moved his finger inside your vagina and it hurt?,3
You just pushed him off?,3
For any reason?,3
SURE. YOU REMEMBER WHEN YOU WERE AT CALICO?,3
Mr. Billups: Question: So you did tell the lady from CALICO?,3
SO YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN WEARING SHORTS OR PAJAMAS?,3
But you just knew that he was photographing you?,3
And that she asked you if it stayed that way the whole time?,3
"So the only adults in the house when you, returned from Victoria Gardens were your mom, your dad, and Tim?",3
"Okay. Now, after that, you were -- went to the forensic interview like I just referenced in the room with the big mirror, and you remember speaking to Laurie Fortin?",3
Okay. And you were crying when you were describing what the defendant had done to you?,3
How did you feel gooey? Like with your hand?,3
You don't remember that?,3
Including the times that you did not want him touching you and he touched you on your body parts that you did not ask him to touch.,3
Okay. And you cried at several different points?,3
And at no point did you talk to your brothers about any of this?,3
So you weren't there?,3
"You told us on direct that he said nothing when he was touching your vagina; is that right? And this is on the couch, he didn't say anything?",3
-- you told the school counselor?,3
And James is the brother who's closer in age to you?,3
"And you objected to that, didn't you? You told him no, don't do that?",3
"And I think you just sort of whispered, ""I do remember this.""",3
No idea how wide? No idea how long?,3
Okay. And now you're stating that it happened only two times.,3
And how long had you known the defendant before? By the time you were 12 years old?,3
OKAY. AND WHY DID YOU SAY THAT TO THE POLICE? I SAID MYSELF OKAY. SO YOU BELIEVED THAT YOUR COUSIN HAD MADE SIMILAR ACCUSATIONS AGAINST LAZARO AT THE TIME THAT YOU SPOKETO THE POLICE?,3
It was just you and her?,3
Okay. And it was at that time you decided to tell your friend Ricky?,3
You two never talk about that?,3
"Okay. Now, you said that he would come into your bedroom.",3
Tell me about that. So you said there was a plan or promise with your dad?,3
"Okay. But you eventually returned back to the home where the defendant was, and everything kind of went back to normal?",3
So at no point did you went up to Jan and said that the defendant had been doing stuff to you?,3
"In other words -- well, you know, like a thong is sort of like a little string on the side, basically.",3
Okay. He never touched your legs?,3
Stuff like that? Okay. And so you felt comfortable with the family?,3
Okay. But you never gave her details about where on your body he touched or anything like that?,3
"No? Did you said when -- at that point, you were standing. And we saw the diagram, you were standing  over by the wall, and you say he ejaculated?",3
So you do know that?,3
And you had to stand up for the judge and kind of show where Mr. Parungao had touched you on your sort of lower area?,3
So your birthday is coming up pretty soon?,3
Okay. So you didn't have to share a room with your brothers or anything like that?,3
"And when you used the computer, how did you get into it? You know what that password is?",3
"Okay. Can you just read what the -- that's you? You don't have to tell us the last name, that's your name right there?",3
And it's true that he did not?,3
"Yes, after you returned to the house and the defendant was still there.",3
Okay. And is that the house -- you live down in Chula Vista?,3
What did you tell her?,0
", BY MR. SMITH: Why were you hiding what you had said?",0
"And so why did you explain to the interviewer that you had been inappropriately touched by your dad, the defendant?",0
Why not?,0
