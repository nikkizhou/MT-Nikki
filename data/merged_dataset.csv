I think you said you're closer to your brother James than you are to Jan; is that right?,3.0
"You didn't tell us about that? You didn't tell them about that, did you?",3.0
"Okay.  Well, you were asked if you wanted anyone else in the room, if you wanted your counselor in the room. You said, ""No. I'm okay. I'll just speak to Ms. Abrego""; correct?",3.0
"And I think I asked you some of these questions this morning, but during that preliminary hearing, he just touched, like, right below the bottom of your belt; right?",3.0
"He never put his penis inside your vagina, did he?",3.0
"You have never even seen his penis before, have you?",3.0

"And when you spoke to Ms. Abrego, no one else was in the room; correct?",3.0
Okay. You actually put your hand across your chest where your breasts are; correct?,3.0
Okay. So your mom gave you details about what the defendant admitted to the detective that day; correct?,3.0

And you soon became aware that the police were involved.  Is that -- is that safe to say?,3.0
"Okay. Now, you said that he would just simply touch the breast area; is that correct?",3.0
"Am I correct that when you were 12 years old, you had never had sex with anyone? And I'll use the word sex defined as penetration with a penis. That had never happened when you were 12, right?",3.0
"If you were to have told Katie Weisberg that your stepdad forced you to have sex with him, that wouldn't be true, would it?",3.0
"Okay. And at the end of that interview, you had some questions for her regarding this apology letter, and she referred you to speak to Detective Ambito; correct?",3.0
Okay. And you told her that it happened about ten times; correct?,3.0
And I think you said the second overexaggeration you told was to the detective; is that right?,3.0
"Okay. Did he you didn't ask him to come in your room, too -- correct? when he would come in late at night; right?",3.0
"That's an old classic, huh? For you it's new, though; is that right?",3.0
Okay. And at that time you disclosed to Ms. Abrego what had happened with the defendant; correct?,3.0
And you didn't feel pressured to talk to her or anything like that; correct?,3.0
"He hasn't e-mailed you, has he?",3.0
Okay. Your mom also told you about the apology letter; correct?,3.0
So he's a really busy guy; right?,3.0
"And let me start out with that, actually.  You told us that the first -- at least one of the overexaggerations you told was to your school counselor Katie Weisberg; is that right?",3.0
Okay. But the only thing that sort of changed was that you weren't allowed to be in the same room or be alone with the defendant; correct?,3.0
"Okay. Now, you said that these touchings would happen when you were asleep; correct?",3.0
And what you meant by that is that he wouldn't actually penetrate your vagina. Isn't that safe to say?,3.0
Okay. You said that also he touched your leg area; is that correct?,3.0
"He hasn't texted you, has he?",3.0
And then let me ask you a question in follow-up then. You told us earlier this morning that Mr. Parungao never touched you on the vagina; is that right?,3.0
You also put your hand down over your vagina; correct?,3.0
So you didn't go in and request him to massage you. Is that safe to say?,3.0
"Now, when you talked to Detective Ambito on May 3rd, 2011, you actually showed him where the defendant had touched you; correct?",3.0
"So explain what happened. First you are with your dad, is what you said, right?",3.0
And he actually moved out of the house sometime in mid-May of 2011; is that right?,3.0
"Now, you told us today that Mr. Parungao never touched you under your underwear or inside your underwear; is that right?",3.0
"And what about in high school?  You didn't go there anymore after school, right?",3.0
And that's as far as you pulled the blanket to your face?,3.0
IS THAT DOESN'T HELP YOU TO REMEMBER?,3.0
"Well, you were also, you told the jury you were mad at Eddie?",3.0
"At CALICO, didn't you say that his hands were up against the wall the entire time?",3.0
And that was the plan that you and your dad came up with?,3.0
"Then after having told the officer at the Fontana Police Department that it didn't happen, you then went to the Children's Assessment Center and said it did happen?",3.0
And you were just frozen staring straight ahead at the wall?,3.0
So your mom didn't warn you at all that she was bringing a romantic figure into your life?,3.0
"So when Janet Doe's older sister came home, all of the adults had already left?",3.0
You would you agree with me you never really wanted to do chores?,3.0
And you wanted to go outside?,3.0
And that's what he was doing?,3.0
Okay. And you indicated that he was touching you?,3.0
In the living room?,3.0
But you told her not to say anything?,3.0
"I think you told the people, the woman at the Children's Assessment Center that the woman, mom, her mom, Maria, called him and that he jerked his hand away from you real quickly and walked outside?",3.0
"(By Ms. Martinez) Okay. Now, I just want to clarify. The defendant actually isn't your biological father?",3.0
"-- correct? And prior to that, the semen coming out on the ground, is when he licked your breast?",3.0
And you ended up getting a ride home from Steed and Shonna?,3.0
You don't recall telling her you had on a long skirt?,3.0
And then the next day the police pick you up and they take you to the CALICO Center in San Leandro?,3.0
AND IN HIS HOUSE THEN -- YOU ARE NOT PROBABLY FAMILIAR WITH SQUARE FEET OF A HOUSE?,3.0
And he had you rub his penis until semen came out?,3.0
"Okay. When you say ""Armando,"" you're referring to the defendant who's here in court? ",3.0
SO YOU DON’T RECALL ANY OTHER TIMES? ,3.0
"And when Mr. Martin sat down, he immediately took the gun out of his pocket and set it down on the table?",3.0
You said he put his hand down your pants?,3.0
"MS. CONDES: Q. So just to be clear, you didn't tell your mom that that happened?",3.0
And you said that his mouth went on your vagina?,3.0
ISN'T IT TRUE THAT THE PARTY HAPPENED FIRST?,3.0
And you went to the bathroom to spit it out?,3.0
"But when you came back, you came back and you went out to the backyard to eat donuts?",3.0
And the purpose of the plan was so your mom would feel angry and sad and not have another affair?,3.0
YOU NEEDED TO PAY?,3.0
Okay. It got your attention?,3.0
So where I am standing here in front of you is about how far you were away from him when you had a conversation with him?,3.0
And you confided in some friends about it?,3.0
"AND WHEN YOU INTERVIEWED WITH CALICO, YOU DIDN'T TELL CALICO THAT YOU HAD TOLD LAZARO TO STOP?",3.0
And you were interviewed by the police at that time?,3.0
You say she wanted to.  Didn't both of you want to go?,3.0
So today was the first day you remembered it when you told the prosecutor?,3.0
And you said no?,3.0
But you did tell the lady about it?,3.0
YOU NEVER HEARD THAT BEFORE?,3.0
As what you've described to us?,3.0
You wanted to just go to your dad's?,3.0
"NOW, ISN'T IT TRUE THAT YESTERDAY YOU TESTIFIED THAT THE PUMPKIN CARVING INCIDENT HAPPENED WHEN YOU WERE SIX OR SEVEN YEARS OLD?",3.0
"Well, you wanted to go meet some friends? ",3.0
"Went home, took a shower, and slept?",3.0
And were you still having sex?,3.0
Okay. So it wasn't always 50/50?,3.0
Okay. Because it was someone other than Bertha?,3.0
"And it was right then that he said, Austin, can you go put this away for me?",3.0
"And when you pushed him off, he got up?",3.0
And Janet Doe was up front sitting beside Mr. Manila? ,3.0
It's the same handwriting from the document you used to write your name when you identified Alejandro?,3.0
"In the Dublin house, he touched your chest?",3.0
"Well, you lived with them since they were born until like 2015.",3.0
And you told her that he asked if it bothered you?,3.0
SO IT WAS DARK? ,3.0
"Okay. It just happened to be in that text, though?",3.0
So you couldn't feel skin to skin at this point?,3.0
"-- talking to the police officers, I asked you how you were feeling, what emotions you remember having; correct?",3.0
And that's when I think you said it was Janet Doe that said we are gonna walk down and get donuts.  And he said I'll take you?,3.0
Yes? You just got home? ,3.0
AND YOU WOULD HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE DEFENDANT AND HE WOULD ASK YOU QUESTIONS OF A SEXUAL NATURE?,3.0
BY MR. SMITH: And I believe you told the jury that you heard him talking with the little girl?  ,3.0
You just remained living with your grandmother?,3.0
"-- about your dad, the defendant, touching you inappropriately?",3.0
Because she was just a few feet away. ,3.0
"OKAY. AND WHEN YOU GOT TO JOB CORPS, YOU FOUND THAT JOB CORPS WAS REALLY DIFFICULT?",3.0
Okay. We've gone over some of the times that the defendant -- that you said that the defendant had inappropriate sexual conduct with you and you're saying today that it's not true?,3.0
She was really upset?,3.0
And that was shocking for you?,3.0
You never tried to talk to him or call him?,3.0
AND YOU LEARNED IT IN SCHOOL BEFORE THE DAY AT GRANDMA ROSA'S?,3.0
And then you told her you were sorry again?,3.0
Okay. So sometimes these pictures were taken of you from behind?,3.0
BUT IT'S NOT AT THE PLACE WHERE THE FIRST INCIDENT TOOK PLACE. IT'S NOT AT A PLACE WHERE THE PARTY HAPPENED AT THE STUDIO. IT'S NOT AT THE STUDIO?,3.0
And you were laying down?,3.0
It happened in Oakland?,3.0
Okay. So you texted her before you talked to anyone that morning other than Jissette?,3.0
"You didn't go into the older sister's bedroom, the three of you, sit down and talk about things?",3.0
You could see her?,3.0
And Austin had one beer?,3.0
You didn't look at the time?,3.0
Okay. so you were mad that your mom had an affair with Alejandro?,3.0
MS. CONDES: Q. Was Derek -- you said he went in to take a nap.,3.0
BUT IT WAS BEFORE THE PRELIMINARY HEARING?,3.0
So you told her through text?,3.0
"BY MR. SMITH: Sure.  Let me rephrase that. I am sorry.  Didn't Janet Doe actually tell you that her mother said no, that you, Jane Doe, had stayed long enough?",3.0
Did he ever take his hand -- you said that he moved his finger inside your vagina and it hurt?,3.0
You just pushed him off?,3.0
For any reason?,3.0
SURE. YOU REMEMBER WHEN YOU WERE AT CALICO?,3.0
Mr. Billups: Question: So you did tell the lady from CALICO?,3.0
SO YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN WEARING SHORTS OR PAJAMAS?,3.0
But you just knew that he was photographing you?,3.0
And that she asked you if it stayed that way the whole time?,3.0
"So the only adults in the house when you, returned from Victoria Gardens were your mom, your dad, and Tim?",3.0
"Okay. Now, after that, you were -- went to the forensic interview like I just referenced in the room with the big mirror, and you remember speaking to Laurie Fortin?",3.0
Okay. And you were crying when you were describing what the defendant had done to you?,3.0
How did you feel gooey? Like with your hand?,3.0
You don't remember that?,3.0
Including the times that you did not want him touching you and he touched you on your body parts that you did not ask him to touch.,3.0
Okay. And you cried at several different points?,3.0
And at no point did you talk to your brothers about any of this?,3.0
So you weren't there?,3.0
"You told us on direct that he said nothing when he was touching your vagina; is that right? And this is on the couch, he didn't say anything?",3.0
-- you told the school counselor?,3.0
And James is the brother who's closer in age to you?,3.0
"And you objected to that, didn't you? You told him no, don't do that?",3.0
"And I think you just sort of whispered, ""I do remember this.""",3.0
