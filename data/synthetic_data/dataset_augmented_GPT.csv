"On Wednesday, during our conversation, you mentioned that when his hand goes there and touches your private area, he remains silent; is that correct?",3
"Two days later, you had a conversation alone with a different officer, isn't that right?",3
"So, your mother was aware that you were drinking, isn't that correct?",3
"Mr. Johnson wasn't your favorite person, was he?",3
"To reach your left side, they would need to lean across you; is that right?",3
"When you talked to the police officer, did he write down everything you mentioned?",3
"YOU ARE LIVING WITH A PERSON YOU CALL YOUR GRANDFATHER, IS THAT RIGHT?",3
"You frequently visited that house between July 4th and December 1st, didn't you?",3
"Is it accurate that this led you to initially suspect Mr. Manila?",3
"So you saw a dim light; is that what you recall?",3
"So, Steven and little Eddie aren't your biological family, is that correct?",3
"The first time you used cocaine in the guest bathroom, was Mr. Spear's wife present in the house?",3
"You were positioned around his knees; isn't that right?",3
"So, whenever you mention your dad, you’re talking about the accused person, right?",3
"It's been a while since then, hasn't it?",3
"It was because you noticed his uniform, wasn't it?",3
"You spent weekdays there and then stayed with your mom on weekends, correct?",3
"Is it alright if I refer to you as Janet Doe?",3
"So, after the penetration ended and you opened your eyes, did you see Alfredo's legs?",3
"It seems you recall some conversations, though not all, isn’t that right?",3
"So, you mentioned that you shared what happened due to feeling upset, right?",3
"MS. CONDES: Q. You ended up being alone in the room with the guns at that time; correct?",3

"So, the haircut event was second and then the pumpkin carving came third, right?",3
"Isn't this the type of reclining sofa you mentioned sleeping on at Janet Doe's house, Jane Doe?",3
"I bet you weren't comfortable with him touching you in that way, were you?",3
"Someone else also lived in that garage, isn't that right?",3
"YOU'RE IN A YELLOW SQUARE, CORRECT?",3
"In the bathroom, you mentioned beginning to feel pain—does that sound right?",3
"I remember you mentioned two bedrooms in the townhouse earlier. When you moved to the second-story apartment in the gray complex, were there still three bedrooms?",3
"Did I understand correctly that you mentioned removing your clothes?",3
"This occurred in the house located in the Oakland Hills, correct?",3
"You viewed a segment of that interview earlier today in the afternoon, right?",3
"You were no longer living at your mother’s house, correct?",3
"Is that right? And the back doesn't actually recline, but rather moves downward like shown in that photo, correct?",3
"It seems you mentioned that it occurred approximately four times; is that correct?",3
"He supported the family financially for quite some time; is that correct?",3
"So, he entered your room by himself and did these things without you inviting him; is that right?",3
"You haven't encountered him, apart from possibly seeing him in court a few times, right?",3
"Actually, your mom mentioned the number of times the defendant was said to have touched you and where he did so; is that right?",3
"Do you remember when you mentioned first telling your friend Ricky, and then the situation was handled, leading to you not being allowed in the house alone with the accused?",3
"Back in 2009, your recollection of those events might have been sharper, isn't that so?",3
"It was your mom who kept you informed about the developments in the case, right?",3
"Alright. I will now proceed with a few additional questions about that. Is it correct that you attended the initial hearing last September?",3
"You know I'm a different person from that previous lawyer, right?",3
"Alright. Prior to this discussion, you had indeed had a conversation with your mother regarding what the defendant mentioned to the detective during her interview on April 29th, 2011; am I right?",3
"It was mentioned earlier that you informed her the person in question had both made contact with your chest and also placed his hands inside your underwear; isn't that so?",3
"It was more recent to May 13th than it is now seeing that we are already in July, isn't it?",3
"Alright. Earlier you mentioned it was fewer than ten times, possibly under eight; is that what you meant?",3
"So, is it correct that you mentioned to her you were 'raped'?",3
"You mentioned to the detective that when asked about how the defendant touched you near your vagina, you said he remained outside rather than going inside, right?",3
"Steed is what you call him, right? Did you notice any alcohol with him?",3
"Right, you mentioned to the detective that he would often touch you whenever your mom went to work at night; is that correct?",3
"Alright. Can you recall the initial occasion you saw him on that Saturday morning?",3
"So, during the interview, you mentioned he only made contact with the chest area; is that right?",3
"Let's talk about the various discussions we've had today regarding the level of help your stepdad offered the family over the years, okay?",3
"In court today, you mentioned that the defendant touched you twice. However, isn't that a different account from what you told Ms. Abrego in February 2011?",3
"It seems you mentioned earlier that you felt questioned by Detective Ambito this morning; is that correct?",3
"He hasn't contacted you by phone after that time, right?",3
"It must have been really difficult for you when all this occurred, right?",3
"You mentioned feeling closer to your brother James compared to Jan, correct?",3
"It seems that this was not mentioned to us before, right?",3
"Alright. So, you were given the option to have someone like your counselor here with us, and you chose to speak to Ms. Abrego alone; is that right?",3
"I remember discussing some of these topics earlier today, but at that initial hearing, he only made contact below your waistband; is that correct?",3
"There was no instance when he inserted his penis into your vagina, right?",3
"I'm sure you've never actually seen his private parts, right?",3
"Mr. Parungao didn't ever do such a thing to you, right?",3
"From what I understand, you mentioned earlier that you don't quite remember speaking with the detective last May; is that correct?",3
"Ms. Abrego was the only person in the room when you talked to her; is that right?",3
"You put your hand across your chest, over your breasts; isn't that right?",3
"Alright, your mom informed you about what the defendant confessed to the detective that day, isn't that right?",3
"I recall there being an issue with not using the fan, which made the bathroom steamy; is that right?",3
"It seems that a CPS investigation began afterward, isn't that right?",3
"So, according to your report, the detective was informed that he reached inside your underwear and made contact in that manner, right?",3
"I previously inquired about certain measurements during the initial hearing, correct?",3
"Can you describe the period between when you spoke with Tina and your conflict with her? I’m curious about how long she kept your secret before revealing it.",3
"I understand you spoke with us earlier this year during a hearing in September; isn't that right?",3
"You noticed that the police were part of the situation, isn't that correct?",3
"So, you mentioned he only touched the chest area, is that right?",3
"When you were 12, you hadn't had any sexual interactions involving penetration with a penis, correct?",3
"You didn't say to Katie Weisberg that your stepdad made you have sex with him, right?",3
"So, after that interview, you wanted to discuss the apology letter with her, but she suggested contacting Detective Ambito instead, right?",3
"So, you mentioned it occurred roughly ten times; is that right?",3
"So, if I remember correctly, the other exaggeration you mentioned was shared with the detective, isn't it?",3
"So, you never invited him into your room, especially when he came in late at night; is that right?",3
"It seems like a timeless classic, don't you think? Is it something new for you?",3
"Alright. During that moment, you mentioned to Ms. Abrego what occurred with the defendant, isn't that so?",3
"You weren't made to talk to her or anything, were you?",3
"He hasn't contacted you by e-mail, correct?",3
"Alright. Your mom mentioned the apology letter to you, didn't she?",3
"It sounds like he's often occupied, isn't that so?",3
"Could you clarify whether the initial exaggeration you mentioned was communicated to your school counselor, Katie Weisberg?",3
"So, the situation altered such that you couldn't be alone with the defendant anymore, is that right?",3
"So, would you say those incidents occurred while you were sleeping, right?",3
"So you were indicating that he never actually went inside your vagina, correct?",3
"So, you mentioned he also made contact with your leg; is that accurate?",3
"It seems he hasn't been in touch, right?",3
"Earlier today, you mentioned that Mr. Parungao never made any inappropriate contact with you; is that correct?",3
"You placed your hand over your vagina as well; is that right?",3
"It's correct that you did not ask him for a massage, right?",3
"During your discussion with Detective Ambito on May 3rd, 2011, you demonstrated the location the defendant touched you; right?",3
"I'm confirming that you mentioned being with your dad when these events occurred.",3
"He moved out of the house around mid-May of 2011, correct?",3
"Earlier, you mentioned that Mr. Parungao didn't touch you under or inside your underwear; is this correct?",3
"You stopped going there after high school, isn't that so?",3
"So, you stopped pulling the blanket when it reached your face?",3
"That doesn’t assist you in recalling, does it?",3
"You mentioned earlier that you were upset with Eddie, correct?",3
"You mentioned at CALICO that his hands remained on the wall throughout, correct?",3
"So, that's what you and your father decided on?",3
"After informing the officer at the Fontana Police Department that nothing occurred, you later told the Children's Assessment Center that it did occur?",3
"So you found yourself frozen, just gazing at the wall without moving?",3
"She didn't give you any heads-up about introducing a new romantic partner into your life?",3
"All the grown-ups had already gone by the time Janet Doe's older sister arrived home?",3
"It seems like you never really wanted to do chores, wouldn't you say so?",3
"You were thinking about heading outdoors?",3
"So, that's what was going on?",3
"So, you mentioned that he was putting his hands on you?",3
"Were you in the living room?",3
"You mentioned that you asked her to keep quiet, correct?",3
"It seems you mentioned to the lady at the Children's Assessment Center that Maria, the mother, reached out to him, and he pulled his hand away from you abruptly before stepping outside?",3
"I want to make sure I understand correctly. The defendant is not your birth father, right?",3
"Is it true that before he ejaculated on the ground, he was licking your breast?",3
"Is it true that Steed and Shonna drove you home?",3
"Is it the case that you have no memory of mentioning to her that you were wearing a long skirt?",3
"They took you to the CALICO Center in San Leandro the following day with the police?",3
"When you were at his place, did you ever think about how large the house was or not really?",3
"He made you touch his penis until something came out?",3
"Alright. Just to clarify, is 'Armando' the person being accused and present in the courtroom?",3
"I GUESS THERE WEREN'T ANY OTHER INCIDENTS YOU REMEMBER?",3
"When Mr. Martin sat down, did he straight away pull the gun from his pocket and place it on the table?",3
"Did you mention that he reached into your trousers?",3
"Wasn't it true that you didn't mention it to your mom?",3
"So, what you mentioned was that he placed his mouth on your private area?",3
"The party took place before, correct?",3
"You went to the bathroom to get rid of it, right?",3
"When you returned, did you head out to the backyard to have donuts?",3
"The idea behind the plan was to make your mom upset and dissuade her from having another affair, correct?",3
"They asked you for money?",3
"So, did that catch your notice?",3
"From where I'm standing in front of you now, does this represent roughly the distance you were from him during your conversation?",3
"You shared what happened with a few friends, didn't you?",3
"I ASSUME YOU DIDN'T MENTION TO CALICO THAT YOU ASKED LAZARO TO STOP DURING YOUR INTERVIEW?",3
"So the police spoke to you back then, correct?",3
"You mentioned she was interested. Was it not the case that both of you were eager to go?",3
"Is today the first time you mentioned it during your conversation with the prosecutor?",3
"You mentioned you refused, is that correct?",3
"You mentioned it to the woman, didn't you?",3
"It seems like you are unfamiliar with that, right?",3
"So, based on what you've mentioned?",3
"It sounds like you were planning on heading over to your father's.",3
"Yesterday, I recall you mentioning during your testimony that the pumpkin carving event occurred when you were around six or seven years old.",3
"You were planning to visit some friends, right?",3
"You went home, cleaned up, and then went to sleep?",3
"So, you were continuing to be sexually involved?",3
"Alright, does that imply it was something other than an even split?",3
"So, it wasn't Bertha, but a different person?",3
"So that was the moment he asked you, Austin, to put this item away for him?",3
"You pushed him away, then he stood up?",3
"Janet Doe was in the front seat next to Mr. Manila, correct?",3
"This appears to be the handwriting you used when you wrote your name after identifying Alejandro, isn't it?",3
"I heard something about an incident in the Dublin house involving touching. Can you elaborate on that?",3
"You were with them from birth until around 2015.",3
"You mentioned telling her about him asking whether it upset you, right?",3
"IT SEEMED TO BE DARK?",3
"So it just ended up being part of the message, then?",3
"There wasn't any direct contact at this stage, right?",3
"I mentioned speaking with the police, and I asked about your feelings and the emotions you recall, right?",3
"It seems you mentioned Janet Doe said you'd be walking to get donuts, and then he offered to go with you?",3
"So, you just arrived home?",3
"It was during these talks with the defendant that he asked you about sexual topics?",3
"BY MR. SMITH: I understand you informed the jury about overhearing his conversation with the young girl.",3
"Your stay continued with your grandmother?",3
"The conversation regarding your dad, the defendant, and inappropriate touching?",3
"She was only a short distance away.",3
"All right. When you arrived at Job Corps, did you notice it was quite challenging?",3
"It's been discussed that the defendant engaged in inappropriate sexual behavior with you. Are you now stating that this isn't accurate?",3
"It sounds like she was quite distressed.",3
"It must have been surprising for you, right?",3
"You never attempted to reach out to him or contact him?",3
"You mentioned learning about it at school prior to visiting Grandma Rosa’s, correct?",3
"So after that, did you apologize to her once more?",3
"Alright. Were there instances where the photos were captured of you from the back?",3
"It isn't the same location as the first incident, not where the party was at the studio, right?",3
"You were lying down then?",3
"The incident took place in Oakland, right?",3
"Alright. You reached out to her through a message before having a conversation with anyone else, besides Jissette, that morning?",3
"The three of you, together with the older sister, didn't sit and discuss anything in her bedroom?",3
"It was visible to you, correct?",3
"Just one beer for Austin, is that correct?",3
"You didn’t notice what time it was?",3
"Your mom being involved with Alejandro made you upset, didn't it?",3
"Can you clarify if Derek was going to rest as you mentioned earlier?",3
"It occurred prior to the initial court hearing?",3
"I understand you communicated with her via text?",3
"Is it true that Janet Doe informed you her mother said, It's time for you, Jane Doe, to leave?",3
"He mentioned moving his finger inside your vagina and causing pain, is that correct?",3
"He was simply pushed off by you?",3
"There isn't a specific reason, right?",3
"It’s okay, you recall being at Calico, right?",3
"Mr. Billups: Statement: You mentioned this to the CALICO representative, didn't you?",3
"It sounds like perhaps you were dressed in either shorts or pajamas?",3
"It seems like you were aware of him taking pictures of you?",3
"What she told you, did it remain the same throughout?",3
"When you got back from Victoria Gardens, were your mom, your dad, and Tim the only adults home?",3
"When you went to the room with the large mirror for the forensic interview, do you recall having a conversation with Laurie Fortin?",3
"It sounds like you were describing what happened with the defendant and became upset?",3
"You mentioned feeling sticky, was it with your hand?",3
"It seems you're not sure about that, is that right?",3
"There were occasions when he touched parts of your body against your wishes, even when you hadn't consented to it.",3
"Alright, so you were upset and tearing up at various moments?",3
"So you never discussed any of these things with your brothers at any time?",3
"It seems like you weren't present, is that correct?",3
"He didn't say a word while he was touching your vagina on the couch, correct?",3
"You mentioned this to the school counselor?",3
"James is the brother that's nearer to your age, right?",3
"You said you didn't agree with that, right? You told him to stop?",3
"It seems like you softly said, I recall this.",3
"Do you really have no clue about the dimensions, like the width or length?",3
"So you're saying it occurred just twice?",3
"For how many years did you know the defendant before you turned 12?",3
"I UNDERSTAND. WHEN YOU SPOKE TO THE POLICE, YOU MENTIONED YOUR COUSIN HAD ALSO ACCUSED LAZARO; WHY DID YOU THINK THAT?",3
"There were no others with you and her?",3
"So, it was then that you thought about sharing this with your friend Ricky?",3
"You and your friend don't ever discuss that?",3
"So, you mentioned that he used to enter your room.",3
"Earlier, you mentioned some kind of arrangement with your father?",3
"So, you went back to the house where the person was living, and did things sort of resume as usual?",3
"You never went to Jan to say that the defendant was doing things to you, correct?",3
"It's like when you have a string on each side, similar to a thong.",3
"So, he didn't make contact with your legs, right?",3
"Things like that? Alright. So, you felt at ease with the family?",3
"Alright. So you didn't describe to her the places on your body where he touched you, correct?",3
"So, when you were at that location by the wall, you mentioned he ejaculated?",3
"It sounds like you're aware of this, right?",3
"It sounds like you needed to demonstrate to the judge where Mr. Parungao had made contact with you on your lower region, is that correct?",3
"You're having a birthday in the near future, right?",3
"You didn't have to bunk with your brothers or anything, right?",3
"When you were using the computer, how did you access it? Do you remember the password?",3
